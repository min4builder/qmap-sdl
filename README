Quickstart:
   "qmap <bspfile>" from directory containing palette.lmp & colormap.lmp
   Terra Nova/System Shock-style controls
   spacebar to halt movement, esc to quit

   If you move outside of the level, execution will be very slow.

Commandline usage:

   Unpak a .pak file so you have a palette.lmp and
   a colormap.lmp in your current directory.  Then
   run

       qmap <bspfile>

   where <bspfile> is an unpak'd bsp file.

   For example:

       qmap start.bsp

   The starting location is about right for start.bsp,
   and works ok for e1m1.bsp as well.

   QMAP uses a lot of memory, because it uses a dumb
   memory layout for reading the bsp file.  I chose
   smaller max sizes than id's utilities, so it's
   possible to have levels which are too big (and
   they'll just barf without being detected).

Controls:

   Use the 'wasd' cluster to move, j/k to go down/up,
   arrow keys to look around.

    w    s          move forward & backward
    a    d          sidestep left & right
    up   down       look up & down
    left right      bank view
    k    j          "sidestep" up & down
